Do you know the Super Gravitron by VVVVVV ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ-3-K1Ro2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ-3-K1Ro2g))? Yes, Terry Cavanagh is a genius! And the bavs tasked with recruiting new programmers made a version of this game that runs on the console, and use it in their recruitment program! We're trying to infiltrate their IT sector, so we need your programming skills to beat the game, by creating a bot that can last 137 seconds in it!

**Instructions:**

**1** - You can only move horizontally, as in the original game, using the directional keys (<- and ->);

**2** - The objective is "just" to avoid the obstacles;

**3** - When you hit an obstacle, it will be marked with an "X". Press <space> or <enter> to exit;

**4** - Press <ESC> or <Q> to close the game at any time;

**5** - The elapsed time and the position of the Jumper(I) are shown in the game screen;

**6** - Run it in full screen mode to avoid problems;
