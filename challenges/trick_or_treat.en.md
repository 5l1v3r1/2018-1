Our central of intelligence discovered an exposed server that seems to be a front website used by The Bavarians. They also ascertained that the administrator's account is called "admin". We need you to hack into his account to find out which secrets they are hiding. Be careful, the server is using an aggressive anti-bruteforce system which blocks you for five minutes after only five wrong login attempts.

**Server**: [http://200.136.252.26](http://200.136.252.26)

**Automated tools are NOT required and NOT allowed, it's a technical challenge!**
