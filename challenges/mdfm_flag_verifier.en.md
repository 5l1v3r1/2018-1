In this challenge you will have access to a file written for the **Manchester Dataflow Machine** assembly language. This machine is based on a tagged token dataflow paradigm, and we found some interesting stuff (below) that can help you in this mission. This technology is used a lot by them, so we need to learn it fast as it'll be very useful in the future.

 * [Architecture docs](http://www.butcher.team/mdfmdocs.pdf)
 * [Hardware implementation](https://github.com/jtsjunior/piflow)

The file provided supplies a fixed output, and you will have to interpret the execution of this program to get the flag.
